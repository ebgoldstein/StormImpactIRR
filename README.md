## IRR Analysis of NOAA Post Storm Images

There are 4 scripts here to use on the 2nd version of release data:

- `Prepdata.R`, which must be run first, and loads the data and pivots it into the needed format.
- `IRRcalc.R`, which calculats the IRR stat (Krippendorf's alpha) for each category.
- `Analysis.R`, which makes some plots and does some data analysis.
- `MovePics.R`, which moves pictures into folders for visual inspection.
